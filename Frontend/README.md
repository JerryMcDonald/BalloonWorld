# Balloon World - Frontend

This is the frontend part of Balloon World, a web-based game built with React and TypeScript, compiled with Vite.

## Features

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. npm (Node Package Manager, it comes with Node.js)

If you do not have these installed:

1. Navigate to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Here, you'll see download options for the latest Node.js version. Download the one appropriate for your system (Windows, Mac, Linux).

2. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm.

3. To verify the installation, open your terminal and run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
If the Node.js and npm versions are displayed, you've successfully installed Node.js and npm.

## Guide

`a` and `d` or the `left` and `right` arrows will move Gerold

`space` to jump

The first button will give a guardian a balloon. But there is no guarantee they will like it

The second button will prepare a colored balloon to give to the guardian

The third button will give that balloon to the guardian

The fourth button will take the guardians balloon away... shame on you...
