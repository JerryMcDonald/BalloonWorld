# BalloonWorld
Gerald was journeying across the vast expanse of Balloon World in his floating house when he realized that the helium in his house's balloons was weakening. Now, he must find a new way to float! However, his path is obstructed, and the only way to pass is by giving three guardians the balloons they desire. The challenge? You must figure out each guardian's favorite color on your own!
